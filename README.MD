### Features

- Added dataset. No need to set any new training data.
- Added dll file too. Not important as of now here.
- Attached .mnist file for data retrieval.
- Can recognize single integer numbers(0-9) only as of now. [single numbers]  
- Can display the accuracy of the result.
- You can draw numbers with your mouse.

### Modules used

> Modules depend on the version of python you're using, as it's the env. Let me tell you my modules. Only versions will change.
1. ```keras```(most important for ML project)
2. ```numpy``` (of course important)
3. ```PIL``` (very interesting module)
4. ```tkinter```(as if you can make GUI without this)
5. ```win32gui```(I've used pywin32 btw)
6. ```tensorflow```(Also important)  

- NOTE:-**Please check if I'm forgetting any module/library. I just forgot them all at once.**
